Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.
Semantic HTML is a modern standard and makes a website accessible for people who use screen readers to translate the webpage and improves your website’s SEO.
<header>, <nav> , <main> and <footer> create the basic structure of the webpage.
<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.
<article> holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.
<aside> contains information that is related to the main content, but not required in order to understand the dominant information.
<figure> encapsulates all types of media.
<figcaption> is used to describe the media in <figure>.
<video>, <embed>, and <audio> elements are used for media files.
The purpose of a <form> is to allow users to input information and send it.
The <form>‘s action attribute determines where the form’s information goes.
The <form>‘s method attribute determines how the information is sent and processed.
To add fields for users to input information we use the <input> element and set the type attribute to a field of our choosing:
Setting type to "text" creates a single row field for text input.
Setting type to "password" creates a single row field that censors text input.
Setting type to "number" creates a single row field for number input.
Setting type to "range" creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.
Setting type to "checkbox" creates a single checkbox which can be paired with other checkboxes.
Setting type to "radio" creates a radio button that can be paired with other radio buttons.
Setting type to "list" will pair the <input> with a <datalist> element if the id of both are the same.
Setting type to "submit" creates a submit button.
A <select> element is populated with <option> elements and renders a dropdown list selection.
A <datalist> element is populated with <option> elements and works with an <input> to search through choices.
A <textarea> element is a text input field that has a customizable area.
When a <form> is submitted, the name of the fields that accept input and the value of those fields are sent as name=value pairs.

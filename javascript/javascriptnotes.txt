Classes are templates for objects.
Javascript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.
Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.
We use the extends keyword to create a subclass.
The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.
Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.
In completing this lesson, youâ€™ve taken one step closer to writing efficient, production-level JavaScript. Good luck as you continue to develop your skills and move into intermediate-level concepts.

Modules.
Modules in Node.js are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program.

module.exports exports the module for use in another program.
require() imports the module for use in the current program.
ES6 introduced a more flexible, easier syntax to export modules:

default exports use export default to export JavaScript objects, functions, and primitive data types.
named exports use the export keyword to export data in variables.
named exports can be aliased with the as keyword.
import is a keyword that imports any object, function, or data type.
